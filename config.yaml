      Source registry of Cloud Controller images.

      By setting to a value, each image listed in the releases manifest
      has its image-registry replaced.

      If unset, the manifests will use the image registry from the kube-control relation

      example)
        juju config openstack-cloud-controller image-registry='rocks.canonical.com:443/cdk'
        juju config openstack-cloud-controller --reset image-registry

    type: string
    description: |
      Specify the version of controller-manager-release as defined by the `release`
      tags of https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack

      example)
        juju config openstack-cloud-controller manager-release='v1.7.3'
      
      A list of supported versions is available through the action:
        juju run-action openstack-cloud-controller/leader list-releases --wait
      
      To reset by to the latest supported by the charm use:
        juju config openstack-cloud-controller --reset manager-release
      
      The current release deployed is available by viewing
        juju status openstack-cloud-controller
